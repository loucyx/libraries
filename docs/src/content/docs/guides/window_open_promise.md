# Window Open Promise Background

`window-open-promise` is a library to wrap the `window.open` function in a
promise, when successful means the window opened, when rejected means the window

ecosystem.

## Why

I wanted to get into publishing libraries to NPM, and I thought of trying that

## How

I was working on a project that was using `window.open` and we had to do that
awkward `null` check to see if the window was opened or not, and I thought it

library and made it into a promise. Later when `async/await` was added, it made
it really easy to use and reason about.

source community. I realize that only when I started getting issues when I
migrated to ESM ðŸ˜….
