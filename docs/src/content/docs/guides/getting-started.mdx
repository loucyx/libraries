## About this site

Lou's code (lou.codes) is a monorepo I ([Lou Cyx](https://lou.cx)) created. It
is the central hub for all my libraries, consolidating resources while
streamlining development and maintaining a cohesive ecosystem of tools and
components.

To make the documentation easy to consume for others, this site relies on
combining the power of two open-source technologies:

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Starlight" icon="starlight">
		It makes this site a reality using the power of [Astro][astro] under the
		hood. Check it out [here][starlight].
	</Card>
	<Card title="TypeDoc" icon="document">
		It generates markdown files from the inline documentation of each
		library. Check it out [here][typedoc].
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

I wish it was as easy as plug-and-play, but I had to write a bunch of custom
logic for that combination to work. Nevertheless, the end result is one I'm
quite happy with.

You'll notice two main sections in the sidebar: **Guides** and **Reference**.

### Guides

**Guides** has the background of each library, separated into 3 sections written
manually by me:

<Steps>

1.  **Why:** My reasoning for creating that library.
2.  **How:** How did I do it (tech used, architecture, etc.).
3.  **Where:** Where I use that particular library.

</Steps>

### Reference

**Reference**, on the other hand, has the auto-generated documentation of each
library. Because it's auto-generated, I must say _üêâ here be dragons üêâ_ mainly
because the inline documentation in the libraries is meant to be used directly
in your editor of choice.
