# Types Background

`@lou.codes/types` is a library of common types and type structures.

## Why

Like many other of my open-source libraries, this one came up when I started
noticing repetition of types across my projects. I then created this and turned
all my other libraries into consumers of this one.

## How

This library makes heavy use of [TypeScript][typescript] and some hacky things
here and there to make it more useful. I also made sure to have an extensive
JSDoc description for each type so the generated documentation is as useful as
it can be.

## Where

This library is used pretty much by all my other libraries, and even at work.
