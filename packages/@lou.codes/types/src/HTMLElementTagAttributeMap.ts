		 * This attribute declares the page's character encoding. It must contain a [standard IANA MIME name for character encodings](https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets). Although the standard doesn't request a specific encoding, it suggests:
		 *
		 * *   Authors are encouraged to use [`UTF-8`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/UTF-8).
		 * *   Authors should not use ASCII-incompatible encodings to avoid security risk: browsers not supporting them may interpret harmful content as HTML. This happens with the `JIS_C6226-1983`, `JIS_X0212-1990`, `HZ-GB-2312`, `JOHAB`, the ISO-2022 family and the EBCDIC family.
		 *
		 * **Note:** ASCII-incompatible encodings are those that don't map the 8-bit code points `0x20` to `0x7E` to the `0x0020` to `0x007E` Unicode code points)
		 *
		 * *   Authors **must not** use `CESU-8`, `UTF-7`, `BOCU-1` and/or `SCSU` as [cross-site scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) attacks with these encodings have been demonstrated.
		 * *   Authors should not use `UTF-32` because not all HTML5 encoding algorithms can distinguish it from `UTF-16`.
		 *
		 * **Notes:**
		 *
		 * *   The declared character encoding must match the one the page was saved with to avoid garbled characters and security holes.
		 * *   The [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta "The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.") element declaring the encoding must be inside the [`<head>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head "The HTML <head> element provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets.") element and **within the first 1024 bytes** of the HTML as some browsers only look at those bytes before choosing an encoding.
		 * *   This [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta "The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.") element is only one part of the [algorithm to determine a page's character set](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/parsing.html#encoding-sniffing-algorithm "Algorithm charset page").

		 * *   It is strongly recommended to define the character encoding. If a page's encoding is undefined, cross-scripting techniques are possible, such as the [`UTF-7` fallback cross-scripting technique](https://code.google.com/p/doctype-mirror/wiki/ArticleUtf7).
		 * *   The [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta "The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.") element with a `charset` attribute is a synonym for the pre-HTML5 `<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=_IANAcharset_">`, where _`IANAcharset`_ contains the value of the equivalent [`charset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#attr-charset) attribute.

		 *
		 *     Send the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin or cross-origin requests.
		 *
		 *     **Notes:**
		 *
		 *     *   Some browsers support the deprecated values of `always`, `default`, and `never` for referrer.
		 *     *   Dynamically inserting `<meta name="referrer">` (with [`document.write`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/write) or [`appendChild`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild)) makes the referrer behaviour unpredictable.

To prevent bandwidth consumption, use a _[robots.txt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/robots.txt "robots.txt: Robots.txt is a file which is usually placed in the root of any website. It decides whether crawlers are permitted or forbidden access to the web site.")_ file.
		 *     *   If you want to remove a page, `noindex` will work, but only after the robot visits the page again. Ensure that the `robots.txt` file is not preventing revisits.
		 *     *   Some values are mutually exclusive, like `index` and `noindex`, or `follow` and `nofollow`. In these cases the robot's behaviour is undefined and may vary between them.
		 *     *   Some crawler robots, like Google, Yahoo and Bing, support the same values for the HTTP header `X-Robots-Tag`; this allows non-HTML documents like images to use these rules.

In earlier browsers, this identified the scripting language of the embedded or imported (via the `src` attribute) code. JavaScript MIME types are [listed in the specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#JavaScript_types).
		 * *   **`module`:** For HTML5-compliant browsers the code is treated as a JavaScript module. The processing of the script contents is not affected by the `charset` and `defer` attributes. For information on using `module`, see [ES6 in Depth: Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/). Code may behave differently when the `module` keyword is used.
		 * *   **Any other value:** The embedded content is treated as a data block which won't be processed by the browser. Developers must use a valid MIME type that is not a JavaScript MIME type to denote data blocks. The `src` attribute will be ignored.
		 *
		 * **Note:** in Firefox you could specify the version of JavaScript contained in a `<script>` element by including a non-standard `version` parameter inside the `type` attribute — for example `type="text/javascript;version=1.8"`. This has been removed in Firefox 59 (see [bug 1428745](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1428745 "FIXED: Remove support for version parameter from script loader")).
